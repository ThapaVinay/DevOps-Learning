						DOCKER

# Why Docker ?
	:) Previously there used to be virtualisation concept where different OS can be run on a sigle machine.
	:) Different OS running will take large resources.
	:) Long time to boot up.
	:) Code works at dev but not in production because dev will have its own kernel and dependencies.


# Containerization :
	:) It is a lightweight isolated virtual runtime environment that includes everything you need to run an application like code, libraries, tools and dependencies.
	
# Docker:
	:) Tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run application y using containers.
	:) Docker file contains all the dependencies which is used to make a docker image.
	:) This docker image is stored in docker hub which is same as github and developers can pull docker image and make container in their own machine.
	
# Components:
	:) Docker file -> text document which contains all the commands to assemble an image.
	:) Docker image -> template to create containers.
	:) Docker container -> isolated application platform to run an application.
	:) Docker registry -> storage component for docker image.
	:) Docker compose -> run mulitple containers as a single service.
	:) Docker Swarm -> cluster of docker daemon
