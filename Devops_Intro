									       DevOps Tutorial

Introduction
-> Previosly we used to have waterfall model for software development.

	* Agile:
-> But then comes agile which breaks the project into different iterations in which developent and testing is done and a product is released at each iteration.

-> The development phase was continuous but not the deployment phase, it was like there was a wall between development and operations team.


	* DevOps
-> DevOps is developent strategy that bridges the gap between the development and operation team.
-> DevOps stages :
	:) Version control - maintains different versions of the code
	:) Continuous integration/build - compile, validate, code review, unit and intergration testing, packaing your app into executable file (WAR, JAR). 
	:) Continuous delivery - continuous testing
	:) Continuous deployment - containerization
	:) Continuous monitoring


___________________________________________

	* Source code management
-> Management of changes in documents, programs, etc.
-> Centralized version control system - contains a single center repo where the commits and updates are done
-> Distributed version control system - every developer maintains a local repository where the commit are done which are at last pushed to the remote repo.

	* Continuous integration
-> Whenever there is a commit in the repo, jenkins server pulls the code and prepare a build.

	* Continuous delivery
-> Jenkins will deploy the build code in test server of end user testing or user acceptance testing.

	* Continuous deployment
-> Deploying the build application onto the production servers
-> It is not advised to automate this process as there are various security checks to take care of.

	* Continuous configuration
-> automating the configuration process with version management - puppet

	* Containerization
-> light weight alternate to virtual machines 
-> it is box containing app and its dependencies which is infinitely replicable.

	* Continuous monitoring
-> Detect, report, respond to the attacks that occur.
-> nagios - notifies the admin about the status of the application using plugins (compiled executable scripts)
